# MARKET CAMPAIGN PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
## Introduction
In today’s digital-first marketing landscape, understanding campaign performance across platforms is essential for maximizing **return on investment** (**ROI**) and driving business growth. This project focuses on analyzing marketing campaign performance for a company running multiple digital campaigns across ***Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest*** to promote its products. The dataset contains detailed daily performance data for each campaign, including impressions, clicks, spend, conversions, and engagement metrics such as likes, shares, and comments. The goal is to assess campaign effectiveness across **channels, cities, and devices**, and to calculate the **return on investment (ROI)** for each campaign.

By conducting this analysis, we aim to:

* Gain insights into what’s working and what’s not,
* Optimize ad spend, and
* Enhance overall marketing efficiency and impact.
