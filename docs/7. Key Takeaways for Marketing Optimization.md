## Key Takeaways for Marketing Optimization
**1. Channel Optimization:**
Pinterest should be prioritized for high-ROI campaigns, while Instagram remains the top channel for engagement-driven campaigns.

**2. Device Strategy:**
Desktop remains more profitable for conversion-based campaigns, but mobile ads should be strategically used to maximize reach and brand visibility.

**3. Ad Format Strategy:**
Discount-focused ads show the best ROI and conversion rates, so consider using them more often, while optimizing Collection Ads for higher conversion.

**4. Budget Allocation:**
Reassess how budgets are distributed across platforms, investing more in high-performing channels (Pinterest) and optimizing spend on Facebook for better returns.

By aligning future strategies with these insights, marketing teams can ensure more efficient campaigns, maximize returns, and improve overall performance across multiple platforms and devices.
